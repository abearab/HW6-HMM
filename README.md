# HW6-HMM

[![HW6-test](https://github.com/abearab/HW6-HMM/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/abearab/HW6-HMM/actions/workflows/main.yml)

In this assignment, you'll implement the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms (dynamic programming). 


I found [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM8wYQRetTxBkdvBtz-gw8b9lcVkdXQKV) helpful for understanding the hidden markov model and the forward algorithm. _The efficient way to compute the probability of a sequence of observations given a model is to use the forward algorithm_.

Also, I found these two github repos helpful for understanding the viterbi algorithm:
- https://github.com/ghadlich/ViterbiAlgorithm/blob/main/python/ViterbiAlgorithm.py
- https://github.com/AzharuddinKazi/Forward-Algorithm-HMM/blob/master/Forward_Algorithm_HMM.py

# Assignment

## Overview 

The goal of this assignment is to implement the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

For a helpful refresher on HMMs and the Forward and Viterbi Algorithms you can check out the resources [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf), 
[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/markov-and-hidden-markov-model-3eec42298d75), and [here](https://pieriantraining.com/viterbi-algorithm-implementation-in-python-a-practical-guide/). 





## Tasks and Data 
Please complete the `forward` and `viterbi` functions in the HiddenMarkovModel class. 

We have provided two HMM models (mini_weather_hmm.npz and full_weather_hmm.npz) which explore the relationships between observable weather phenomenon and the temperature outside. Start with the mini_weather_hmm model for testing and debugging. Both include the following arrays:
* `hidden_states`: list of possible hidden states 
* `observation_states`: list of possible observation states 
* `prior_p`: prior probabilities of hidden states (in order given in `hidden_states`) 
* `transition_p`: transition probabilities of hidden states (in order given in `hidden_states`)
* `emission_p`: emission probabilities (`hidden_states` --> `observation_states`)



For both datasets, we also provide input observation sequences and the solution for their best hidden state sequences. 
 * `observation_state_sequence`: observation sequence to test 
* `best_hidden_state_sequence`: correct viterbi hidden state sequence 


Create an HMM class instance for both models and test that your Forward and Viterbi implementation returns the correct probabilities and hidden state sequence for each of the observation sequences.

Within your code, consider the scope of the inputs and how the different parameters of the input data could break the bounds of your implementation.
  * Do your model probabilites add up to the correct values? Is scaling required?
  * How will your model handle zero-probability transitions? 
  * Are the inputs in compatible shapes/sizes which each other? 
  * Any other edge cases you can think of?
  * Ensure that your code accomodates at least 2 possible edge cases. 

Finally, please update your README with a brief description of your methods.
